# Potential Features
- List of all comment delimiters for each language (#, //)
- Group by different keywords
- Cost and priority optionality
- Tool to convert existing todos into tudus
- search parameter
- directory parameter
- man page


### Two parts
- knocking out tudu's when developing
- looking at the status of a project based on commit history

Do I want a gui component to it?

Ideal product:
- website version
- plugins for vscode
- file change listeners to update the website on file changes
  - why do i need this?

What problem am I trying to solve?
- developer efficiency in going from task to code
- is that a problem?
- better identification of refactoring

KISS
- tudu
  - returns an ordered list of tudu's within that folder

Ideas:
- have a file extension that doesn't need the todo comment but can follow a format that auto parses out high level todos
  - kind of like this file

- the character before the Todo should be customizable. default is '~'. and then the other keywords could be customizeable as well.

- Maybe I should git grep by different file types. I could then bucket the todos by language?
