# Notes

## Libraries that could be used in the future
- [commander] (https://github.com/tj/commander.js/)
  - alternative to yargs which I currently have imported
- [inquirier] (https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js)
  - this is for command line questions and interactive answers, would be great for setup
- [typescript-starter] (https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter)

## Helpful guides
- [How To Create Your Own TypeScript CLI — With Node.js] (https://medium.com/@jeroenouw/how-to-create-your-own-typescript-cli-with-node-js-1faf7095ef89)
- [Step by step: Building and publishing an NPM Typescript package.] (https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c)

## Random notes
If I make changes to package.json or change how the command is called run
```
npm install -g
```
to re-create the symlinks to the current project.
